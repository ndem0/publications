    abstract = {As repeatedly pointed out, the present book focuses for the most part on parametrized partial differential equation (PDE) problems. In many cases of interest, the input parameters of such PDE problems happen to be associated with the shape of the computational domain, or of one of its portions. For instance, virtual prototyping applications very often investigate the influence that the shape of a given craft or artifact has on its predicted performance. In some case, through repetitive resolution of PDE systems, such applications go as far as identifying the optimal shape of the craft or artifact under study, or quantifying the sensitivity of its performance to variations of its geometry. In these last cases, the virtual prototyping application pipelines will include optimization or uncertainty quantification tools. Naturally, such mathematical algorithms can only be fed with numbers. Thus, the main purpose of shape parametrization is to map any geometric variation of the object under study to variations of numbers—the parameters—which can then be processed by any other mathematical algorithm used in the virtual prototyping pipeline. }
