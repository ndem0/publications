  abstract = {As a major breakthrough in artificial intelligence and deep learning, Convolutional Neural Networks have achieved an impressive success in solving many problems in several fields including computer vision and image processing. Real-time performance, robustness of algorithms and fast training processes remain open problems in these contexts. In addition object recognition and detection are challenging tasks for resource-constrained embedded systems, commonly used in the industrial sector. To overcome these issues, we propose a dimensionality reduction framework based on Proper Orthogonal Decomposition, a classical model order reduction technique, in order to gain a reduction in the number of hyperparameters of the net. We have applied such framework to SSD300 architecture using PASCAL VOC dataset, demonstrating a reduction of the network dimension and a remarkable speedup in the fine-tuning of the network in a transfer learning context.}
