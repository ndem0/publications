    abstract = {In the previous chapters we discussed a wide range of aspects of the reduced basis (RB) approach, presenting different applications and different couplings with the traditional discretization methods for the resolution of partial differential equations (PDEs). Such applications have in common that, independent of the solver, the construction of the reduced order model (ROM) requires knowledge of the actual mathematical model and access to the operators describing the PDE in order to project them onto the reduced space. }
