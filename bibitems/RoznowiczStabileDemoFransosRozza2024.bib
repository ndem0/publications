    abstract = {The article presents the application of inductive graph machine learning surrogate models for accurate and efficient prediction of 3D flow for industrial geometries, explicitly focusing here on external aerodynamics for a motorsport case. The final aim is to build a surrogate model that can provide quick predictions, bypassing in this way the unfeasible computational burden of traditional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. We investigate in this contribution the usage of graph neural networks, given their ability to smoothly deal with unstructured data, which is the typical context for industrial simulations. We integrate an efficient subgraph-sampling approach with our model, specifically tailored for large dataset training. REV-GNN is the chosen graph machine learning model, that stands out for its capacity to extract deeper insights from neighboring graph regions. Additionally, its unique feature lies in its reversible architecture, which allows keeping the memory usage constant while increasing the number of network layers. We tested the methodology by applying it to a parametric Navierâ€“Stokes problem, where the parameters control the surface shape of the industrial artifact at hand, here a motorbike.},
