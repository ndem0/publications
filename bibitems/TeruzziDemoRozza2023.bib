    abstract={Fault detection has a long tradition: the necessity to provide the most accurate diagnosis possible for a process plant criticality is somehow intrinsic in its functioning. Continuous monitoring is a possible way for early detection. However, it is somehow fundamental to be able to actually simulate failures. Reproducing the issues remotely allows to quantify in advance their consequences, causing literally no real damage. Within this context, signed directed graphs have played an essential role within the years, managing to model with a relatively simple theory diverse elements of an industrial network, as well as the logic relations between them.\\ In this work we present a quantitative approach, employing directed graphs to the simulation and automatic reconfiguration of a fault in a network. To model the typical operation of industrial plants, we propose several additions with respect to the standard graphs: 1. a quantitative measure to control the overall residual capacity, 2. nodes of different categories - and then different behaviors - and 3. a fault propagation procedure based on the predecessors and the redundancy of the system. The obtained graph is able to mimic the behaviour of the real target plant when one or more faults occur. Additionally, we also implement a generative approach capable to activate a particular category of nodes in order to contain the issue propagation, equipping the network with the capability of reconfigure itself and resulting then in a mathematical tool useful not only for simulating and monitoring, but also to design and optimize complex plants. The final asset of the system is provided in output with its complete diagnostics, and a detailed description of the steps that have been carried out to obtain the final realization.},
