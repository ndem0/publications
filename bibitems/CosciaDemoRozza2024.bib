    abstract = {In this work, we present GAROM, a new approach for reduced order modeling (ROM) based on generative adversarial networks (GANs). GANs attempt to learn to generate data with the same statistics of the underlying distribution of a dataset, using two neural networks, namely discriminator and generator. While widely applied in many areas of deep learning, little research is done on their application for ROM, i.e. approximating a high-fidelity model with a simpler one. In this work, we combine the GAN and ROM framework, introducing a data-driven generative adversarial model able to learn solutions to parametric differential equations. In the presented methodology, the discriminator is modeled as an autoencoder, extracting relevant features of the input, and a conditioning mechanism is applied to the generator and discriminator networks specifying the differential equation parameters. We show how to apply our methodology for inference, provide experimental evidence of the model generalization, and perform a convergence study of the method.},
