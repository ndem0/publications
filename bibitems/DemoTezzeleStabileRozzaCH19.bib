    abstract = {Scientific Open-Source Software for Reduced Order Models We dedicate this section to the more technical aspects of the software for reduced order modeling (ROM). Whereas in the previous chapters several methodologies were introduced, we consider it important to present the developed packages to our readers, helping them choose the right framework. }
