Several parametric deformations of an initial hull shape are considered to assess the influence of the shape parameters considered on the hull total drag. The hull resistance is typically computed by means of numerical simulations of the hydrodynamic flow past the ship. Given the high number of parameters involved - which might result in a high number of time consuming hydrodynamic simulations - assessing whether the parameters space can be reduced would lead to considerable computational cost reduction. Thus, the main idea of this work is to employ the active subspaces to identify possible lower dimensional structures in the parameter space, or to verify the parameter distribution in the position of the control points.  To this end, a fully automated procedure has been implemented to produce several small shape perturbations of an original hull CAD geometry which are then used to carry out high-fidelity flow simulations and collect data for the active subspaces analysis. To achieve full automation of the open source pipeline described, both the free form deformation methodology employed for the hull perturbations and the solver based on unsteady potential flow theory, with fully nonlinear free surface treatment, are directly interfaced with CAD data structures and operate using IGES vendor-neutral file formats as input files.

On the other hand, kinetic mesoscale approaches based on the Boltzmann equation, have the potential to describe a broad range of flows, stretching well beyond the special case of gases close to equilibrium, which results in the ordinary Navier-Stokes dynamics. Here, we demonstrate that, by properly tuning, a kinetic approach can statistically reproduce the quantitative dynamics of the larger scales in turbulence, thereby providing an alternative, computationally efficient and physically rooted approach toward subgrid scale (SGS) modeling in turbulence. More specifically, we show that by leveraging data from fully resolved direct numerical simulation (DNS), we can learn a collision operator for the discretized Boltzmann equation solver (the lattice Boltzmann method), which effectively implies a turbulence subgrid closure model. The mesoscopic nature of our formulation makes the learning problem fully local in both space and time, leading to reduced computational costs and enhanced generalization capabilities.

The motivation behind compressing the architecture of an existing Convolutional Neural Network arises from its usage in embedded systems with specific storage constraints. The conducted numerical tests demonstrate that the resulting reduced networks can achieve a level of accuracy comparable to the original Convolutional Neural Network being examined, while also saving memory allocation. Our primary emphasis lies in the field of image recognition, where we tested our methodology using VGG-16 and ResNet-110 architectures against three different datasets: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and a custom dataset.", "issn": "1573-7497", "doi": "10.1007/s10489-023-04730-1"}, {"bibitem": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ndem0/pubblications/master/bibitems/RoznowiczStabileDemoFransosRozza2024.bib", "title": "Large-scale graph-machine-learning surrogate models for 3D-flowfield prediction in external aerodynamics", "journal": "Advanced Modeling and Simulation in Engineering Sciences", "year": "2024", "issn": "2213-7467", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s40323-024-00259-1", "url": "https://amses-journal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40323-024-00259-1", "author": "D.

We investigate in this contribution the usage of graph neural networks, given their ability to smoothly deal with unstructured data, which is the typical context for industrial simulations. We integrate an efficient subgraph-sampling approach with our model, specifically tailored for large dataset training. REV-GNN is the chosen graph machine learning model, that stands out for its capacity to extract deeper insights from neighboring graph regions. Additionally, its unique feature lies in its reversible architecture, which allows keeping the memory usage constant while increasing the number of network layers.

Basically, it exploits a set of precomputed high-fidelity solutions --- computed for properly chosen parameters, using a full-order model --- in order to find the low dimensional space that contains the solution manifold. Using this space, an approximation of the numerical solution for new parameters can be computed in real-time response scenario, thanks to the reduced dimensionality of the problem. In a ROM framework, the most expensive part from the computational viewpoint is the calculation of the numerical solutions using the full-order model. Of course, the number of collected solutions is strictly related to the accuracy of the reduced order model. In this work, we aim at increasing the precision of the model also for few input solutions by coupling the proper orthogonal decomposition with interpolation (PODI) --- a data-driven reduced order method --- with the active subspace (AS) property, an emerging tool for reduction in parameter space. The enhanced ROM results in a reduced number of input solutions to reach the desired accuracy.

Exploiting proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) as a dimensionality reduction technique, DMD is able to approximate a dynamical system as a sum of spatial bases evolving linearly in time, thus enabling a better understanding of the physical phenomena and forecasting of future time instants. In this work we propose an extension of DMD to parameterized dynamical systems, focusing on the future forecasting of the output of interest in a parametric context. Initially all the snapshots\u2014for different parameters and different time instants\u2014are projected to a reduced space; then DMD, or one of its variants, is employed to approximate reduced snapshots for future time instants. Exploiting the low dimension of the reduced space, we then combine the predicted reduced snapshots using regression techniques, thus enabling the possibility of approximating any untested parametric configuration in the future.

Applications must then exploit both directions of parallelism to run efficiently. In this work we focus on the efficient use of vector instructions. These process several data-elements in parallel, and memory data layout plays an important role to make this efficient. An optimal memory-layout depends in principle on the access patterns of the algorithm but also on the architectural features of the processor. However, different parts of the application may have different requirements, and then the choice of the most efficient data-structure for vectorization has to be carefully assessed. We address these problems for a Lattice Boltzmann (LB) code, widely used in computational fluid-dynamics. We consider a state-of-the-art two-dimensional LB model, that accurately reproduces the thermo-hydrodynamics of a 2D-fluid. We write our codes in C and expose vector parallelism using directive-based programming approach. We consider different data layouts and analyze the corresponding performance. Our results show that, if an appropriate data layout is selected, it is possible to write a code for this class of applications that is automatically vectorized and performance portable on several architectures.
