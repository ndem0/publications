Several parametric deformations of an initial hull shape are considered to assess the influence of the shape parameters considered on the hull total drag. The hull resistance is typically computed by means of numerical simulations of the hydrodynamic flow past the ship. Given the high number of parameters involved - which might result in a high number of time consuming hydrodynamic simulations - assessing whether the parameters space can be reduced would lead to considerable computational cost reduction. Thus, the main idea of this work is to employ the active subspaces to identify possible lower dimensional structures in the parameter space, or to verify the parameter distribution in the position of the control points.  To this end, a fully automated procedure has been implemented to produce several small shape perturbations of an original hull CAD geometry which are then used to carry out high-fidelity flow simulations and collect data for the active subspaces analysis. To achieve full automation of the open source pipeline described, both the free form deformation methodology employed for the hull perturbations and the solver based on unsteady potential flow theory, with fully nonlinear free surface treatment, are directly interfaced with CAD data structures and operate using IGES vendor-neutral file formats as input files. The computational cost of the fluid dynamic simulations is further reduced through the application of dynamic mode decomposition to reconstruct the steady state total drag value given only few initial snapshots of the simulation.

On the other hand, kinetic mesoscale approaches based on the Boltzmann equation, have the potential to describe a broad range of flows, stretching well beyond the special case of gases close to equilibrium, which results in the ordinary Navier-Stokes dynamics. Here, we demonstrate that, by properly tuning, a kinetic approach can statistically reproduce the quantitative dynamics of the larger scales in turbulence, thereby providing an alternative, computationally efficient and physically rooted approach toward subgrid scale (SGS) modeling in turbulence. More specifically, we show that by leveraging data from fully resolved direct numerical simulation (DNS), we can learn a collision operator for the discretized Boltzmann equation solver (the lattice Boltzmann method), which effectively implies a turbulence subgrid closure model. The mesoscopic nature of our formulation makes the learning problem fully local in both space and time, leading to reduced computational costs and enhanced generalization capabilities. We show that the model offers superior performance compared to traditional methods, such as the Smagorinsky model, being less dissipative and, therefore, able to more closely capture the intermittency of higher-order velocity correlations. This foundational study lays the basis for extending the proposed framework to different turbulent flow settings and\u2014most importantly\u2014to develop new classes of hybrid data-driven kinetic-based models capable of faithfully capturing the complex macroscopic dynamics of diverse physical systems such as emulsions, non-Newtonian fluid, and multiphase systems.", "eprinttype": "arXiv", "eprintclass": "physics.flu-dyn", "eprint": "2403.18466", "issue": "1", "pages": "013202", "numpages": "6", "year": "2025", "month": "Feb", "publisher": "American Physical Society", "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevResearch.7.013202"}, {"bibitem": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ndem0/pubblications/master/bibitems/CosciaDemoRozza2024.bib", "title": "Generative Adversarial Reduced Order Modelling", "author": "D.

The framework offers the possibility to model the failure propagation, estimating the overall condition of the system before and after the damage and exploit such a health index for dynamic recalibration. To model the typical operation of industrial plants, we propose several additions with respect to the standard graphs: i) a quantitative measure to control the overall condition of the system ii) nodes of different categories\u2013and then different behaviors\u2013and iii) a fault propagation procedure based on the predecessors and the redundancy of the system.

We adopt reduced order models in order to improve the efficiency of the overall optimization, keeping a modular and equation-free nature to target the industrial demand. We applied the above mentioned pipeline to a realistic cruise ship in order to reduce the total drag. We begin by defining the design space, generated by deforming an initial shape in a parametric way using free form deformation. The evaluation of the performance of each new hull is determined by simulating the flux via finite volume discretization of a two-phase (water and air) fluid. Since the fluid dynamics model can result very expensive---especially dealing with complex industrial geometries---we propose also a dynamic mode decomposition enhancement to reduce the computational cost of a single numerical simulation.

Basically, it exploits a set of precomputed high-fidelity solutions --- computed for properly chosen parameters, using a full-order model --- in order to find the low dimensional space that contains the solution manifold. Using this space, an approximation of the numerical solution for new parameters can be computed in real-time response scenario, thanks to the reduced dimensionality of the problem. In a ROM framework, the most expensive part from the computational viewpoint is the calculation of the numerical solutions using the full-order model. Of course, the number of collected solutions is strictly related to the accuracy of the reduced order model. In this work, we aim at increasing the precision of the model also for few input solutions by coupling the proper orthogonal decomposition with interpolation (PODI) --- a data-driven reduced order method --- with the active subspace (AS) property, an emerging tool for reduction in parameter space.

An optimal memory-layout depends in principle on the access patterns of the algorithm but also on the architectural features of the processor.

Our results show that, if an appropriate data layout is selected, it is possible to write a code for this class of applications that is automatically vectorized and performance portable on several architectures.

In this work we propose an extension of DMD to parameterized dynamical systems, focusing on the future forecasting of the output of interest in a parametric context. Initially all the snapshots\u2014for different parameters and different time instants\u2014are projected to a reduced space; then DMD, or one of its variants, is employed to approximate reduced snapshots for future time instants. Exploiting the low dimension of the reduced space, we then combine the predicted reduced snapshots using regression techniques, thus enabling the possibility of approximating any untested parametric configuration in the future.
